1. NEVER git add or commit unless I explicitly ask you to.
1. NEVER create markdown files explaining your findings unless I explicitly ask you to.
1. NEVER create pointless comments, such as "Increased this because ...". ONLY create comments that are absolutely necessary to explain or share context for future readers of the code.
1. When creating markdown docs:
    1. ONLY use title case for headings where it is explicitly required, such as the title of a book. In all other cases, use sentence case.
    1. Limit emoji use to only where it is genuinely required.
    1. Limit use of bold and italics to only where emphasis is genuinely required.
1. When writing tests:
    1. NEVER take shortcuts, such as skipping a test case if something isn't working for you or in our environment. Always communicate issues you're running into and tell me what you need.
1. Ensure that code is DRY where possible and reasonable. If we can re-use some code the default should be to do so, rather than duplicating. If we need to refactor to make re-use possible then this is fine unless I have explicitly said otherwise.
1. Always program defensively. It is far better to fail loudly when an invariant is violated or we're unable to handle something, rather than silently ignoring the issue.
